			<h2>Summary</h2>
			
			<p><span class="tab"></span>Most of my life feels like a blur. I remember I used to love trains, had pac-man on cd, and watched saturday morning cartoons 
			near religiously. Most of my time was spent doing things that made me feel less bored. I never fully understood my high-functioning 
			autism diagnosis; it was a label to me. I was stubborn and quickly attached to things I did like. Minecraft was one of them. I just 
			liked the simplicity of learning how a game works. I think this is what drew me into my future career path.</p>
			
			<p><span class="tab"></span>The first time I had an idea of what I wanted to do was when I attended a program called Saturday Academy. It was hosted by 
			Portland State University and was primarily a programming camp. I looked at the underlying code for Command-and-Conquer and was 
			intrigued by how much coding goes into a game like this. I think this was what started it. It also helped that an aptitude test 
			I took suggested being a web designer was in my top ten suggestions on jobs I could get into. Despite this it took me nearly 
			seven to ten years to actually start this path. I had maxed out all my credits by the time I graduated from Clark College with 
			an Associates in Science Transfer Track 2 (the Computer Science track). My first College years were used to satisfy my PE 
			requirements for High School. I spent most of my time there as a part time student and my best times there were with the 
			Outdoors and Recreation Program. I was obviously out of my element, but continued to participate in the group as it felt pretty 
			relaxing. I also spent more time with the the STEM group during the last years, participating in meetings, fundraisers, and 
			events related to the club. I still have a picture of one such event where we sold desserts. However I trended toward Computer 
			Science fields and transferred to WSU Vancouver to complete my degree.</p>
			
			<p><span class="tab"></span>WSU Vancouver helped round out my education in the Computer Science field. I attended computer theory, web design, operating 
			systems, and cloud computing courses. I also attended the Gamer's club on campus which put me into contact with new colleagues. 
			I fondly remember sitting with one friend and having good times while waiting for my ride home. I somehow am blanking on their 
			name at the time of this writing, but I am glad that they did talk with me as it made me less lonely. I never got back to them 
			on an anime we were talking about (Dr. Stone). The pandemic hit during my University years and messed with my routines to the 
			point where I stopped going to regular meetings and I barely remember the people I spent time with. Keeping up with my courses 
			was not an issue even as classes went online to maintain social distancing requirements. I thouroughly enjoyed one course where 
			we talked about multiple programming languages such as Shakespeare. My last year was spent working on autolab backend environment. 
			This is where I learned Ruby and Ruby on Rails (to a degree). I wish I could say I made progress, however the issue was left 
			unresolved as it required assistance. Fighting these setbacks, I graduated in 2021 with my Bachelors in Computer Science. After 
			this I did my best to keep learning what I did not know, with one instance introducing me to React. Most of the year though was 
			not that productive, and I still worry to this day that I am only falling behind. I am still hopeful though, so I keep busy 
			however I can.</p>
			
			<p><span class="tab"></span>Some of my favorite things involve the television, the computer, and some books. I personally love the video game collection 
			I have accrued, ranging from computer games, XBox titles, and eventually Playstation games. Among these the top favorites are 
			Horizon: Zero Dawn, Forza Horizon, the recent Tomb Raider games, the Uncharted series, Halo 4, God of War (reboot), Spore, and 
			the most recent Just Cause games (3 and 4). I tended to be a fan of singleplayer, offline game titles as the internet where I 
			live is not the best. I became interested in anime during my college years, and it quickly balloned even before the pandemic. 
			I eventually started watching shows as random as Kill la Kill, FullMetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, Gurren Lagan, Knights & Magic, 
			Gurren Lagan, One Piece, and Miss Kobayashi's Dragon Maid. I also became more inclined to watch Studio Ghibli titles such as 
			My Neighbor Totoro, Castle in the Sky, and Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind. This further led me to collecting tv shows that 
			were staples of my young life, such as Teen Titans (the original cartoon series), Pokemon, Justice League, Tom and Jerry, and 
			what are probably lesser known titles (ex: Swat Kats: the Radical Squadron). Youtube was the second most popular thing that I 
			spent my time watching. Programming has become more of a side practice that my full-time career, but I consistently tried to 
			keep learning new things that would help me with the medium. I especially found new ways to improve my HTML, CSS, and javascript 
			skills with examples such as this. I also found more helpful guides on making simple things in these languages as well as open 
			source sites for things I could apply, such as ionic icons' collection of icons. Despite being all over the place, I kept busy 
			as much as possible and intend to keep doing so.</p>
